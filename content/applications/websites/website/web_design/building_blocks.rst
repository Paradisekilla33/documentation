Building blocks
===============

It is possible to add and design your content without coding by dragging and dropping building
blocks from the website builder onto your web pages. Odoo classifies them into four categories:
:guilabel:`Structure`, :guilabel:`Features`, :guilabel:`Dynamic Content`, and :guilabel:`Inner
Content`.

Adding a building block
=======================

To add a building block to your website page, click :guilabel:`Edit`, select the desired building
block, and drag and drop it to the correct zone of your page. You can add as many blocks as needed.

To edit the content of a building block, click on it and go to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab.

.. Note::
   The features available in the :guilabel:`Customize` tab depend on the block you selected.

Color preset and background
===========================

You can customize and apply :guilabel:`Color Presets` to your site's building block. To proceed,
select a building block, go to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, click the :guilabel:`Background`
button, and select the desired :guilabel:`Preset`.

When you modify a color preset that has been previously applied to specific elements on your site,
those elements automatically update to reflect the changes made to the selected preset.

Layout: Grid vs Cols
====================

Go to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab and then change the :guilabel:`Layout` of a selected element to
:guilabel:`Grid` or :guilabel:`Cols` in the :guilabel:`Banner` section.

Grid
----

The :guilabel:`Grid` layout allows you to reposition and resize elements, such as images or text, by
dragging and dropping them to the desired place.

Cols
----

The :guilabel:`Cols` feature is available for some blocks like :guilabel:`Columns` or
:guilabel:`Image - Text` blocks. By choosing the :guilabel:`Cols` :guilabel:`Layout`, you can
determine the number of elements per line within the block.

.. note::
   In the mobile view, only one element per column is used by default for better visibility.
   However, you can adjust this setting without impacting the desktop view.

Duplicating a building block
============================

You can replicate a building block by clicking on the duplicate icon. Once duplicated, the new block
appears on your website beneath the original one.

Re-ordering building blocks
===========================

To re-order the building blocks on your site, select the block you want to move and click the up
arrow to move it before the previous section or click the down arrow to move it after the following
section.

You can also use the drag-and-drop icon to move your block manually.

Show/Hide on mobile
===================

You can hide specific elements of your website for mobile devices. To do so, select the element
to hide, and in the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, scroll down to :guilabel:`Visibility`, and click the
:guilabel:`Show/Hide on Mobile` icons.

You can decide to show/hide with :guilabel:`No condition` or
:guilabel:`Conditionally`, depending on :guilabel:`Country` (based on Geo IP), :guilabel:`Languages`
(for multi-language websites), :guilabel:`UTM Campaign`, :guilabel:`UTM Medium`,
:guilabel:`UTM Source`, or :guilabel:`Users`.

The elements hidden on mobile/desktop view appear in the :guilabel:`Invisible Elements` section at
the bottom of the configurator. Click on a specific element to make it re-appear on screen.

.. tip::
   Click the phone icon at the top of the configurator to see how your website looks on mobile.

Saving a custom building block
==============================

You can save your favorite custom building blocks on other site pages for future use. Select the
custom building block you want to save, navigate to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, and click the
floppy disk icon to store it to use it later.
